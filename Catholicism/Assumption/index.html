        <h2>The Assumption:</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>What is it?   <img style="width: 300px;" src="https://angelusnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shutterstock_1483137671-copy-scaled.jpg" alt="the assumption"></h3>

        <p>Dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII in 1950 in his encyclical, Munificentissimus Deus.<br>
        <br>The dogma of the Assumption teaches that at the end of her time on earth, Mary was taken up—body and soul—into heaven. There, she sits at her Son’s right hand, as Queen of Heaven and Earth. <br>
        <br>This is a Holy Day of Obligation in the Church.<br>
        <br>The Orthodox denomination and some Eastern Catholic Rites call this feast day the ‘Dormition’ - the ‘falling asleep’ of the Virgin Mary.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Where can we find it in the Bible?</h3>

        <h4>Revelation 12:1-5 <br> The Woman and the Dragon:</h4>
        <p><b>1</b> A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. <b>2</b> She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. <b>3</b> Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. <b>4</b> Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. <b>5</b> She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.<br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Historical Evidence of the Assumption</h3>
        <p>Presence of relics - there are two tombs dedicated to Our Lady in Ephesus and Jerusalem however, neither contain relics.<br>
        <br><b>Writings of the Apostles and Early Church Fathers:</b><br>
        <br>St Ephiphanius says, “Like the bodies of the saints, <img style="width: 200px; float: left;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_-_Coronation_of_the_Virgin_-_Prado.jpg" alt="mary queen of heaven">however, she has been held in honour for her character and understanding. And if I should say anything more in her praise, she is like Elijah, who was virgin from his mother’s womb, always remained so, and was taken up, but has not seen death” (Panarion 79).</p>

        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Only THREE people are in Heaven with their bodies; Jesus Christ, Elijah and Mary.</li><br>
            <li>It affirms her immaculate conception and sinless nature.</li><br>
            <li>It allows her to fully intercede for us, as Queen of Heaven.</li><br>
            <li>We will share in Christ’s resurrection.</li><br>
            <li>Helps us understand that Earth is not our home and that we must work to be like Mary to get to Heaven.</li>
            </ul>
