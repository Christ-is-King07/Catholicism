        <h2>Confession:</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        
        <p>Purification of self and allows us to seek and receive forgiveness from God.<br>
        <br>Learn to rely on his guidance and be more open to His will for our lives.<br>
        <br>Confession allows us to hold ourselves accountable for these sins and seek true forgiveness. The soul needs confession to cleanse itself, allowing us to repair our relationship with Christ.<br>
        <br>Removing the weight of sin on ones soul.<br>
        <br>“Confess your sins in church, and do not go up to your prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way of life. . . . On the Lord’s Day gather together, break bread, and give thanks, after confessing your transgressions so that your sacrifice may be pure” (Didache 4:14, 14:1 [A.D. 70])</p>
        
        <h3>Why confess to a priest?</h3>

        <p>"Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven… For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.” Matthew 18:18-20 <br>
        <br>Acting in persona Christi - Apostles and their successors are merely ambassadors for Christ (2 Cor. 5:20), bringing his forgiveness to the world through the sacraments and the message of the gospel.<br>
        <br>“Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained” John 20:22-23<br>
        <br>The sacrament of confession does not add to or take away from the finished work of Christ. It is evidence of the finished work of Christ in our midst.</p>

        <h3>Breaking the fear!</h3>

        <p>“Confession is an act of honesty and courage – an act of entrusting ourselves, beyond sin, to the mercy of a loving and forgiving God.” - Pope St John Paul II <br>
        <br>Pope Benedict XVI said “… whatever the sin committed, if it is humbly recognized and the person involved turns with trust to the priest-confessor, he or she never fails to experience the soothing joy of God’s forgiveness.” <br>
        <br>The person who you truly are confessing to already knows your sin and WANTS to forgive you.
