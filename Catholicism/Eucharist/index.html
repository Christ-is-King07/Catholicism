        <h3>Institution of the Eucharist</h3>

        <p>The term “Eucharist” originates from the Greek word eucharistia, meaning thanksgiving.<br>
            <img style="width: 400px;" src="institution of the eucahrist.jpg" alt="institution of the eucahrist">
        <br>It is an act of thanksgiving to God.<br>
        <br>Occurs at the Last Supper but its importance is throughout scripture.<br>
        <br><b>Matthew 26:26-29:</b><br>
        <b>26</b> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” <b>27</b> Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. <b>28</b> This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. <b>29</b> I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”<br>
        <br>In the celebration of the Eucharist, bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit and the instrumentality of the priest.<br>
        <br>The whole Christ is truly present -- body, blood, soul, and divinity -- under the appearances of bread and wine, the glorified Christ who rose from the dead. This is what the Church means when she speaks of the "Real Presence" of Christ in the Eucharist.<br>
        <br>Symbolising the unity of the Church with Christ and with each other as members of the Church.<br>
        <br>The presence of Christ in the Eucharist is real, true and substantial.<br>

        <h3>John 6:47-59:</h3>

        <p><b>47</b> Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. <b>48</b> I am the bread of life. <b>49</b> Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. <b>50</b> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. <b>51</b> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”<br>
            <br><b>52</b> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” <br>
            <br><b>53</b> Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <b>54</b> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. <b>55</b> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <b>56</b> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. <b>57</b> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <b>58</b> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” <b>59</b> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</p>

        <p>The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life, It nourishes our soul, We become united to Christ through the Eucharist; a tabernacle. Christ provides Himself for us to be redeemed; He gives Himself to us as spiritual nourishment.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Saint Quotes:</h3>
        <p><b>Saint Maximilian Kolbe - </b><br>“If angels could be jealous of men, they would be so for one reason: Holy Communion.<br>
        <br><b>Saint Padre Pio - </b><br>“A thousand years of enjoying human glory is not worth even an hour spent sweetly communing with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.”<br>
        <br><b>St Francis - </b><br>“O sublime humility! O humble sublimity! That the Lord of the whole universe, God and the Son of God, should humble himself like this and hide under the form of a little bread, for our salvation.”
