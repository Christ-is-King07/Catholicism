        <h3>Hierarchy:</h3>
        <p>Hierarchy means the "holy ordering" of the church, the body of Christ. <br>
        <br>The hierarchy of the Catholic Church consists of the following roles and positions: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Pope</li>
            <li>Cardinal</li>
            <li>Archbishop</li>
            <li>Bishop</li>
            <li>Priest</li>
            <li>Deacon</li>
            <li>Laity - The people</li>
            </ul></p>

        <p>The pope is the Bishop of Rome. Also by virtue of that office the pope is the Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles (Saint Peter) and the Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church.<br>
        <br>The first pope in history is Saint Peter who was given authority by Jesus Christ to continue his ministry. (<a href="st_peter.html">More information</a>) <br>
        <br>The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus personally appointed Peter as the visible head of the Church, presenting the latter as the successors of the former, with the pope as successor of Peter, in that he is head of the bishops as Peter was head of the apostles.</p>

        <p>Cardinals are created by the pope and typically hold the title for life. Collectively, they constitute the College of Cardinals. The most solemn responsibility of the cardinals is to elect a new pope in a conclave, almost always from among themselves (with a few historical exceptions), when the Holy See is vacant. <br>
        <br>The day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. <br>
        <br>Cardinals are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, being appointed as cardinals in addition to their existing roles within the Church. Most cardinals are bishops and archbishops leading dioceses and archdioceses around the world – often the most prominent diocese or archdiocese in their country. </p>

        <p>An archbishop is the highest order of bishop in the Christian Church. They are in charge of the churches and bishops within an assigned area or diocese. An archbishop is in place to oversee a larger diocese known as an archdiocese. <br>
        <br>Though an archbishop is of a higher rank within the church hierarchy than a bishop, the archbishop does not rank above a bishop in a sacred sense. <br>
        <br>There is no new sacrament that a bishop must receive when being named an archbishop, but if a church representative is being promoted to the office of an archbishop and is not already an ordained bishop, he must first be ordained as a bishop.</p>

        <p>A bishop is an ordained minister who holds the fullness of the sacrament of holy orders and is responsible for teaching doctrine, governing Catholics in his jurisdiction, sanctifying the world and representing the Church. <br>
        <br>A bishop has the power to make church laws, be a judge in church matters and to enforce observance of these laws. These laws generally relate to worship, preaching, administration of the sacraments, safeguarding the faith and morals of the faithful and religious instruction.</p>

        <p>A Catholic priest is a man called by God to serve Christ and the Church through the reception of the sacrament of Holy Orders.<br>
        <br>A priest has the power and authority delegated by God to act in His name for the salvation of His children. <br>
        <br>As the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, the priest serves the faithful by building up and guiding the Church in the name of Christ, who is head of the body (CCC #1547).</p>

        <p>Deacons are members of the clergy along with priests and bishops. The deacon’s ministry has three dimensions: liturgy, word and service.  At the liturgy, he assists the bishop and priests.  At the Mass, the deacon proclaims the Gospel, may be invited to preach the homily, and assists at the altar. <br>
        <br>All Christians are called, but the deacon serves with a special grace – a unique authority and humble power.  He is responding to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.  He is sent by the Church to be the presence of Christ to those in need. </p>

        <p>Laity is a term that applies to the non-ordained members of the Body of Christ. Lay women and men are those individuals at work in the world, transforming society towards the image of Christ Jesus.<br>
        <br>The Laity consists of all members who are not part of the clergy, usually including any non-ordained members of religious orders, e.g. a nun or a lay brother.</p>
