        <h3>Who is St Peter?</h3>
        <p>St Peter also known as Simon Peter, Simon or Peter the Apostle, born in Judea (Time Unknown), and died between 64-68 AD, was one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ and one of the first leaders of the early Christian Church. Catholicism recognises St Peter as the first Bishop of Rome or Pope and the first bishop of Antioch. <br>
        <br>Early Church tradition says that Peter died by crucifixion (with arms outstretched) at the time of the Great Fire of Rome in the year 64. This was said to have taken place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor Nero wished to blame the Christians. <br>
        <br>Based on contemporary historical data, Peter's papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years; however, this has never been verified. Peter was canonised Pre-Congregation.</p>

        <h3>St Peter's Discipleship:</h3>
        <p>Peter is always listed first among the Twelve Apostles in the Gospels and in the Book of Acts. Along with James the Elder and John he formed an informal triumvirate within the Twelve Apostles. Jesus allowed them to be the only apostles present at three particular occasions during his public ministry, the Raising of Jairus' daughter, Transfiguration of Jesus and Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.Peter often confesses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
