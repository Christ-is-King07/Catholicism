        <h3>Who is St Peter?</h3>
        <p>St Peter also known as Simon Peter, Simon or Peter the Apostle, born in Judea (Time Unknown), and died between 64-68 AD, was one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ and one of the first leaders of the early Christian Church. Catholicism recognises St Peter as the first Bishop of Rome or Pope and the first bishop of Antioch. <br>
        <br>Early Church tradition says that Peter died by crucifixion (with arms outstretched) at the time of the Great Fire of Rome in the year 64. This was said to have taken place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor Nero wished to blame the Christians. <br>
        <br>Based on contemporary historical data, Peter's papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years; however, this has never been verified. Peter was canonised Pre-Congregation.</p>

        <h3>St Peter's Discipleship</h3>
        <p>Peter is always listed first among the Twelve Apostles in the Gospels and in the Book of Acts. Along with James the Elder and John he formed an informal triumvirate within the Twelve Apostles. Jesus allowed them to be the only apostles present at three particular occasions during his public ministry, the Raising of Jairus' daughter, Transfiguration of Jesus and Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br>
        <br>Peter often confesses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The author of the Acts of the Apostles portrays Peter as the central figure within the early Christian community. <br>
        <br>Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the first place of honor and authority. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first Pope. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other bishops. However, Peter never bore the title of "Pope" or "Vicar of Christ". <br>
        <br>The Catholic Church's recognition of Peter as head of its church on earth (with Christ being its heavenly head) is based on its interpretation of passages from the canonical gospels of the New Testament, as well as sacred tradition. The Passage that shows this message clearly is: <br>
        <br>Matthew 16:18-19:<br>
        I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</p>

        <h3>Denial of Jesus</h3>
        <p>All four canonical gospels recount that, during the Last Supper, Jesus foretold that Peter would deny him three times before the following cockcrow ("before the cock crows twice" in Mark's account). The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:</p>
        <ol style="font-size: 20px">
            <img style="width: 320px; margin-left: -50px; margin-top: -20px;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/El_Greco_-_Las_l%C3%A1grimas_de_San_Pedro.jpg/440px-El_Greco_-_Las_l%C3%A1grimas_de_San_Pedro.jpg" alt="The tears of Saint Peter">
            <li>A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), "the rooster crowed". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people</li><br>
            <li>A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (per Mark) or another servant girl (per Matthew) or a man (per Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, "the rooster crowed". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of Gethsemane when Jesus was arrested.</li><br>
            <li>A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, "the rooster crowed". Matthew adds that it was his accent that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.</li>
