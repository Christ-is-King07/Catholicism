        <h3>What is the Rosary?</h3>
        <p>The Rosary is a set of Prayer beads said to be handed down to St Dominic during a vision in which he encountered the Blessed Virgin Mary. <br>
        <br>The Rosary consists of 59 beads, the 6 large beads are used for praying the Our Father, and the 53 smaller beads are used for praying the Hail Mary. <br>
        <br>The Rosary is used to allow the individual to meditate and reflect on the life of Jesus Christ, the different hardships and trials faced and the significant events of his life from his Birth to his Death and Resurrection. <br>
        <br>The Secrets of the Rosary is the best book in indicating what the Rosary is, the power in which it contains, and its high spiritual ranking.</p>
        
        <h3>How to pray the Rosary</h3>
        <p>The Rosary is one of the most cherished prayers of our Catholic Church. <br>
        <br>Started by the Creed, the Our Father, three Hail Marys and the Glory Be, the Rosary involves the recitation of five decades consisting of the Our Father, 10 Hail Marys and the Glory Be. <br>
        <br>The Rosary is then Concluded with the Salve Regina (Hail Holy Queen) <br>
        <br>During the recitation, the individual meditates on the saving mysteries of Jesus’ life. (Mysteries gone through below).<br></p>

        
        <h3>St Dominic:</h3>
        <img style="float: right; width: 250px;" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhtKnAi8PKS7HQZLWYPGdzQy0RzOI1r0rYaQ&s" alt="St Dominic">
        <p>During the vision and revelation of The Virgin Mary to St Dominic, The Blessed Virgin Mary promised St. Dominic and all who followed that “Whatever you ask in the Rosary will be granted.”<br>
        <br>While some dispute the historical account of the presentation of the Rosary by Our Lady to St. Dominic, many theologians and Popes have upheld this understanding. History reveals that St. Dominic was the first to preach and teach the Rosary as a form of meditative prayer, and the first to see the benefits reaped from meditation upon its mysteries. <br>
        <br>In the 11th through 13th centuries, a heretical doctrine developed in Europe. This teaching, called Albigensianism, taught that only the spiritual is good, and that everything material is bad. Therefore, the body in and of itself is evil, and every person’s soul is imprisoned in that evil body. The only way in which a person could experience salvation was to be freed from the imprisonment of their flesh. <br>
        <br>The Marian Psalter was a prayer, which involved praying 150 Hail Mary’s divided into groups of 10 by Our Fathers. Prayer beads were used to keep track of the Hail Mary’s. It was not a meditative prayer, though, nor one that would have been “preached.” Mary revealed to St. Dominic which mysteries should be preached to correspond to the Psalter prayers: stories of Christ’s life which directly contradicted the heresy of the Albigensians by focusing on the incarnation, death, and triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>
        <br>Pope Leo XIII said, “Thanks to this new method of prayer… piety, faith, and union began to return to France; and the project and devices of the heretics to fall to pieces.” <br>

        <br>In 1213, only five years after St. Dominic was given the Rosary, Catholic forces under the joint command of Count Simon de Montfort and St. Dominic were set to fight the Albigensians in Muret, a small town near Toulouse, France. <br>
        <br>The Albigensians were determined to take over France, further spreading their heretical beliefs. Catholics, of course, were determined to fight for Christ. Unfortunately, reinforcements had failed to arrive for the Catholic forces, and the numbers were bleak. The Catholics had only 1500 men, while their foe had 30,000. <br>
        <br>Confident of their upcoming success, the Albigensians spent the night before the battle celebrating in drunkenness and debauchery. The Catholics, on the other hand, spent their night praying the Rosary; their celebration was focused on that of the Mass and the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Finally, St. Dominic went to the Church of Saint-Jacques in Muret to pray the Rosary for victory, while the Count went into battle. The Catholics were able to rush upon the hung-over Albigensians, routing the enemy army and declaring a victory for Christ and Our Lady. After the battle, every Catholic in the area attributed the victory to the Rosary. <br>
        <br>While the Albigensian sect continued to exist, its territorial expansion ceased and it never again reached the massive numbers it enjoyed prior to the battle of Muret. <br>
        <br>As we continue to fight against heretics of one sort or another in our current day and age, St. Dominic remains a hero to be remembered. Even more so the Rosary, a gift given by Our Lady all those years ago, remains a vital tool to winning the battle of good versus evil, and Truth versus falsehood.</p>

        <h3>Promises of the Rosary</h3>
        <p>Mary revealed to St Dominic 15 specific promises to those who faithfully pray the Rosary. These promises are:<br>
        <ol style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; border-radius: center; font-size: 20px;">
                <li>Whosoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.</li><br>
                <li>I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.</li><br>
                <li>The Rosary shall be a powerful armour against hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.</li><br>
                <li>It will cause good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire for Eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means!</li><br>
                <li>The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary shall not perish.</li><br>
                <li>Whosoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its Sacred Mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of Eternal Life.</li><br>
                <li>Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.</li><br>
                <img style="width: 400px; height: 250px; float: left;" src="https://i0.wp.com/santuariosantocristo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/anuja-mary-tilj-GreoBzJqQtw-unsplash-1024x536-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C536&ssl=1" alt="The Rosary on the Bible"><li>Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the Light of God and the plenitude of His Graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the Merits of the Saints in Paradise.</li><br>
                <li>I shall deliver from purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.</li><br>
                <li>The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of Glory in Heaven.</li><br>
                <li>You shall obtain all you ask of me by recitation of the Rosary.</li><br>
                <li>All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.</li><br>
                <li>I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.</li><br>
                <li>All who recite the Rosary are my Sons and brothers of my only Son Jesus Christ.</li><br>
                <li>Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.</li><br>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Rosary being Idolatory?</h3>
        <p>A common argument towards Catholics is that the Rosary is a form of idolatry. The reason they believe this is because of the thought that we pray to Mary which is completely wrong. The Rosary is used to ask Mary for intercession through the words, “...Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us sinners...” <br>
        <br>This becomes a common misconception when trying to disprove the validity of Catholicism as a similar argument is made towards the Maronite Catholics in terms of St Charbel. </p>
