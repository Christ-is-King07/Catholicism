        <h3>Who is Padre Pio?</h3>
        <p>Born on the 25th of May 1887, Francesco Forgione, venerated as Saint Padre Pio, was an Italian Capuchin friar, priest, stigmatist, and mystic. Pio joined the Capuchins at fifteen and spent most of his religious life in the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo. Padre Pio was marked by stigmata in 1918, leading to many investigations by the holy see. Despite temporary sanctions imposed by the Vatican, his reputation kept increasing during his life, attracting many followers to San Giovanni Rotondo.<br>
        <br>He was the founder of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, a hospital built near the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo.<br>
        <br>After his death, his devotion continued to spread among believers all over the world. He was beatified on 2 May 1999 and canonized on 16 June 2002 by Pope John Paul II.<br></p>
