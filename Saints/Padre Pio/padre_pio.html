        <h3>Who is Padre Pio?</h3>
        <p>Born on the 25th of May 1887, Francesco Forgione, venerated as Saint Padre Pio, was an Italian Capuchin friar, priest, stigmatist, and mystic. Pio joined the Capuchins at fifteen and spent most of his religious life in the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo. Padre Pio was marked by stigmata in 1918, leading to many investigations by the holy see. Despite temporary sanctions imposed by the Vatican, his reputation kept increasing during his life, attracting many followers to San Giovanni Rotondo.<br>
        <br>He was the founder of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, a hospital built near the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo.<br>
        <br>After his death, his devotion continued to spread among believers all over the world. He was beatified on 2 May 1999 and canonized on 16 June 2002 by Pope John Paul II.<br></p>

        <h3>Facts about Padre Pio:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>On Sept. 20, 1918, Padre Pio received the stigmata while praying in a church. The wounds remained visible on his body for the rest of his life. The wounds were on his hands, feet and side, corresponding to the wounds suffered by Jesus during his crucifixion. </li><br>
            <li>Padre Pio Said “Confession is the soul’s bath. You must go at least once a week. I do not want souls to stay away from confession for more than a week. Even a clean and unoccupied room gathers dust; return after a week, and you will see that it needs dusting again!”</li><br>
            <li>Among the most remarkable of the documented cases of bilocation was Padre Pio’s appearance in the air over San Giovanni Rotondo during World War II. When the American bombers appeared over the city and prepared to unload their munitions, a brown-robed friar appeared before their aircraft. All attempts to release the bombs failed. In this way, Padre Pio kept his promise to the citizens that their town would be spared.</li>

        <h3>Stigmata:</h3>
        <p>Pio wrote in his letters that, early in his priesthood, he experienced bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations indicative of the (not yet visible) stigmata. <br>
        <br>In a 1915 letter, Agostino asked Pio specific questions, including: when he first experienced visions, whether he was stigmatic, and whether he felt the pains of the Passion of Christ, namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. <br>
        <br>Pio replied that he had had visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904) and that he was stigmatic, adding that he had been so terrified by the phenomenon that he begged God to withdraw his stigmata. He also wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since he considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation. <br>
        <br>On 20 September 1918, while hearing confessions, Pio was said to have had a reappearance of the physical occurrence of the stigmata. His stigmatism reportedly continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers. <br>
        <br>In August 1918, a few weeks before reportedly receiving the stigmata, Pio described a mystical experience during which he felt being pierced and burnt spiritually and physically. <br>
        <br>According to Pio, this mystical experience began on 5 August and ended on 7 August. Padre Benedetto, his spiritual director, interpreted this phenomenon as a transverberation. Pio later claimed that this experience left a physical wound on his left side. <br>
        <br>Most witnesses who examined Pio's wounds reported that he had a wound on his left side, around three-inches long and the shape of a cross.</p>
