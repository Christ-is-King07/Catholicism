        <h3>Who is St Charbel?</h3>
        <p>Born on the 8th of May 1828, Youssef Antoun Makhlouf, venerated as Saint Charbel, was a Maronite monk and priest from Lebanon. During his life, due to his ability to unite Christians, Muslims and Druve, Youssef had obtained a wide reputation for holiness. After living the final 23 years of his life in solitude, Charbel Makhlouf passed away due to a stroke on December 24, 1898.<br>
        <br>Saint Charbel is widely known as the 'Miracle Monk of Lebanon' because of the immense number of miracles performed through his intercession. Charbel Makhlouf was later beatified in 1965 and canonised in 1977 by Pope Paul VI.<br>
        <br>He is revered as a Saint and is celebrated on the 24th of July by the Latin Church, and on the Third Sunday of July by the Maronite Church.<br> </p>
        
        <h3>Facts about Saint Charbel:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2nd Most recorded Miracles in History, approximately 50,000. He is second behind Mary, The Mother of God.</li><br>
            <li>Pope Paul VI stated during Saint Charbels beautification: <br>“A hermit of Mount Lebanon is enrolled in the number of the blessed… a new eminent member of monastic sanctity has by his example and his intercession enriched the entire Christian people … may he make us understand, in a world largely fascinated by wealth and comfort, the paramount value of poverty, penance and asceticism, to liberate the soul in its ascent to God.”</li><br>
            <li>In 1875, Charbel was granted by the abbot of the monastery the privilege of living as a hermit at the Hermitage of Saints Peter and Paul, a chapel under the care of the monastery.</li>

        <p><ul>
            <li>Saint Charbels most Memorable Miracle was one performed on Nohad El Shami, an old 55-year-old lady at the time of the miracle who was healed of Partial Paralysis.</li><br>
            <li>She says that on the night of January 22, 1993, she dreamt of two Maronite monks standing next to her bed. One put his hands on her neck and operated on her, relieving her from her pain, while the other held a pillow behind her back. When she awoke, she found two wounds in her neck, one on each side. She was completely healed and recovered her ability to walk. </li><br>
            <li>She believed it was the saint who healed her but did not recognize the other monk. The next night, she dreamt of Makhlouf, who said: "I did the surgery to let people see and return to faith. I ask you to visit the hermitage on the 22nd of every month, and attend Mass regularly for the rest of your life”.</li><br>
            <li>People now gather on the 22nd of each month to pray and attend Mass in the hermitage of Saint Charbel in Annaya and all over the world.</li>

        <p><ul>
            <li>In 1994, a Lebanese Maronite Catholic named Raymond Nader experienced a profound mystical encounter while praying at the hermitage in Annaya. He described the event saying, "I found myself in another world…I saw a strange and amazing Light unlike any light I had ever seen; it was a sea of light that extended from one end of the universe to the other. I wanted that Light to stay permanently." </li><br>
            <li>As Nader was leaving, near the statue of Saint Charbel, he felt a warmth and itching sensation on his arm. Upon rolling up his sleeve in the car, he discovered the imprint of five fingers. He described it as "They were engraved like a hand on my arm and encircled by a red glare as if imprinted through fire. But I felt nothing but warmth."</li><br>
            <li>Dr. Nabil Hokayem, a Beirut-based plastic surgeon, examined the mark and determined it resembled a third-degree burn, even though Nader felt no pain. The mark has since mysteriously faded and reappeared multiple times.</li><br>
            <li>Inspired by this experience, Nader founded the Family of Saint Sharbel in 1995, a prayer group dedicated to supporting the Catholic Church’s evangelizing mission by living out Saint Charbel’s spirituality. Nader also claims that Saint Charbel has appeared to him on numerous occasions, with 16 of the saint’s messages, or locutions, published to date.</li>
